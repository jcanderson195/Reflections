Today at DevCodeCamp, we focused on new assignments that Mike provided for us after our netflix project. At this point my mindset is simply taking everything day by day. I want to be successful in this program. I really do. I want to be at that level where the advanced group is. I want to able to approach projects and feel confident about the knowledge that I know and be able to put my best foot forward and show that I can do this. In all honesty this program to me is almost a do or die sort of situation because if I don't make it through, I don't know what I want to do for a career. I don't want to go back to traditional college going and taking classes that are useless and won't benefit me in the future. Being in this program made me realize that being in college can be huge waste of time and money because more than half of your time in college is spent taking classes that don't relate to what you are trying to get a degree in. I really want t do well here and I'm pushing myself harder and harder but there are times where I just feel like I'm not good enough compared to everyone else. I'm trying. I am literally giving it every ounce of my being to feel a part of this world here at devCodeCamp.
