Today at DevCodeCamp, the morning focus for FL2 was getting our lemonade stand projects ready to be turned in at 1:30pm. For my project, I had to change some of the rules around in my game and give a bit of a twist. The twist was that the player/owner of the lemonade stand has to buy their items in bulk before they go out and sell lemonade for the week. Once they deploy to sell lemonade, they cannot go back and purchase more items. I ended up changing the starting budget from 100 dollars to 200 dollars just to give the user a bit more leverage when it comes to buying their items for the week. They also will not know the weather until they open up for business each day. This way, the twist is that the user has to buy their items on a wim assuming that he will buy enough for the entire week and not run out prematurely. I got this idea to implemement except for the idea of the inventory decreasing whenever a sale is made and then displaying the inventory thats left after each given day. After we turned in our lemonade stand projects, we got the chance to watch Mike, Andrew, and Adam create their version of lemonade stand in front of us. After that, we got the chance to go back and work on our lemonade stand project some more and improve upon what we turned in today to turn in tomorrow morning. I will definitely take advantage of that and try to improve what I have for my lemonade stand project. Overall, I feel pretty good after leaving today.
