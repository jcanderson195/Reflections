Today at DevCodeCamp we finished working on our java adventure stories in the morning and were able to get feed back on our projects. According to my mentor, I did pretty good with how I setup my project. Unlike friday, I believe I have a good grasp now on how to apply functions to my main project to reduce the amount of code I have in the main class. We it came to lecture today, we discussed loops and inheritance in Java. I have experience dealing with loops because of the pre work I did with coding langauges like javascript and python. The loop is pretty similar in Java that's why I believe I have a good understanding of it. After noticing that functions and loops are similar in other coding languages, I understand why our instructors tell us to get a good grasp on these concepts because they are crucial part of coding and we'll use them a lot. At this point, its good to learn these things early because it will only benefit you in the future. I will continue to progress my skills and practice new techniques to better my analyzing skills when it comes to figuring out how to solve problems in coding. Overall, a good day at DevCodeCamp.
