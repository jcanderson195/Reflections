Today at DevCodeCamp, the instructors decided to officially split the class into two groups. One group was the advanced learners who already had experience in coding and then there's the regular paced group who held the individuals with little to no coding experience. I was placed in the regular paced group. I was happy to have been placed here because I know that I have experience in coding but I'm not confident enough in my abilites to be in the advanced group. Even if the instructors felt that it would be good for me to be in the advanced group, I still would have decided to be in the regular group. I really want to hone my skills and I feel that the regular paced group will allow me to do that. Overall, a good day at DevCodeCamp.
