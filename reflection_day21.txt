Today at DevCodeCamp, we continued to work on our Lemonade Stand projects. The day started off really well. I was figuring out my store operations and getting the inventory to show as you progressed through the item purchasing process. I hit an obstacle when I was trying to get my inventory display after the item purchasing process along with the weather condition, temperature, and potential customers. I figured out the dispaly for the inventory but now my obstacle is that when I want the option to go back and purchase more items, it doesn't keep track of the old values that the user inputs before, along with the wallet balance from before, and the weather condition and temperature change each time I choose the option to buy more items. The next step that I'm going to work on is the customer personalities and how to get them coordinate with the potential customer amount and how many of those potential customers are a specific customer personality type. Overall, great work day, just very frustrating when you hit a wall and not sure how to get over but you want to figure it out on your own so that you feel more accomplished after the fact.
