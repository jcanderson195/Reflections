Today at DevCodeCamp, majority of our time was dedicated to working on our animal shelter projects. I made great progress throughout the day and actually got to mvp around 3:00pm. I'll look over the project at home tonight but overall I'm satisfied with my project and hopefully I can get a high grade just like my lemonade stand project. Overall, awesome productive day here at DevCodeCamp.
