Today at devCodeCamp, we had a morning lecture with Dave where we got to watch him code problems that we would eventually have to solve ourselves. The catch was that we were not allowed to take notes on what he was doing. The idea is that we would watch him and see how he would solve the problems and we would go back and figure them out ourselves. Like many of my classmates, I tried to memorize everything that Dave did for each problem. That wasn't the purpose of the lecture at all. We were supposed to get the problems without any instructor showing us what to do but they felt it would be a better learning experience. I got through the problems but I had trouble figuring out problem 4. I eventually got it and completed the problems. Overall, a hard working day at devCodeCamp.
