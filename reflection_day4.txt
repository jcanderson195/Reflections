Today at DevCodeCamp, we received our grades back from the exam we took yesterday. I was a little surprised at the score I received which was a 94%. I thought I was going to get like a 80 something. That was a grreat way to start my morning. We started Java today and so far, things are going well. The only thing I struggled with today was the second Java assignment which took into account overtime hours and pay into our pay calculator. After an hour of trying to figure it out on my own, I asked Nick for some help. We ended solving the problem and I was able to finish that assignment. Now I have to create my story using if statements and switch statements which I know will take some time since I'm still relatively new to Java. Once again, another succesfull day at DevCodeCamp.
