Today at DevCodeCamp, we focused on the Netflix Catalog project. I'm still struggling to understand what I need to do to complete the requirements for the project. I know what my end product would look like, I just don't know what to do for the requirements part of the project. I'll just keep trucking forward on it and hopefully a light bulb will turn on for me.
