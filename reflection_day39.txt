Today at devcodecamp, the morning focus was on the ICustomerString project. I got through two classes and now am on the last one for this half of the project. I'll ask my group members if I'm doing these classes right tomorrow morning when I come in. I'll be working on the last class tonight and hopefully get it done before I come in tomorrow. I may start the sweepstakes part of the project tonight as well but I'm not guaranteeing that I will tonight. The video that Luke shared with us should help me a lot tonight when it comes to the last class. The majority of the second half of the day was spent in lecture learning about Concurrency and concurrency in C#. The lecture once again was really long and the information was pretty confusing. I'm still not 100% on the information that we learned. I guess I would just have to do some reasearch on the topics myself in my free time. Tomorrow is friday, its the end of the week, and I'm pretty burnt out. Kinda looking forward to that 3 hour lunch break tomorrow just to kind of ease my mind from all the work we've been given this week. Overall, a very information filled day here at devcodecamp.
