Today at DevCodeCamp, we covered arrays and lists in lecture. I believe I have a good grasp on these concepts because of the code academy tutorials. The big thing that happened today was that we were assigned our first multi day project. The project is to create a dice game in Java that has a single player mode that consists of the user playing the computer and a multiplayer mode where the two human users play each other. Another key detail is that we have to implement dice that are different sizes. The sizes we have to create are a 4 sided die, 6 sided die, 8 sided die, 10 sided die, 12 sided die, and a 20 sided die. This was a partner project and my partner is Carlos. We started the project today and we made great progress. We got up to where the user makes the first roll in the single player mode. I know this project is going to take some time to complete but I confident of me and Carlos' abilities in Java to make a great game. Tomorrow will be long but we got this!
