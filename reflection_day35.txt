Today at devcodecamp, our focus was working on soda machine. I've made a lot of progress and hopefully this weekend I'll have some time to work on it so I'm not in a mad frenzy come monday morning to get the project done on time. Looking forward to the great weather this week. Good day at devcodecamp.
