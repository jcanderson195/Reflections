Today at DevCodeCamp, we once again focused on working on our lemonade stand projects. We had a lecture at 10:30 with Ben about the different ways of testing our code. The lecture was very informative but I feel it was geared more towards FL1 because some of the terms and vocabulary they were using, we in FL2 hadn't learned yet. So a lot of the information kind of flew right over my head in a sense that I didn't think I would need that information until I got a little further in my coding journey. After that, we had lunch and then we focused on lemonade stand again. For the past two days, I have been stuck on the road blocks of the inventory keeping track of itself after the user selects to purchase more items, the wallet balance reseting after the user selects to purchase more items, and the weather condition and temperature didn't stay the same after the user selects to purchase more items. I'm happy to say that I sucessfully surpassed my road blocks and can now move forward with my project. I hate to say it but the issues were simple to fix with the help of one of the instructors and I figured out the weather condition and temperature issue all by myself. I'm so happy to be able to move forward and complete my project by the end of the day tomorrow. Overall, a frustratingly successful day at DevCodeCamp.
