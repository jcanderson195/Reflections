Today at devcodecamp, the morning's focus was to finish our soda machine project. I still had a decent amount to do seeing as I didn't get a chance to work on it over the weekend. I ran in to a small bug right before lunch but I fixed shortly after lunch started so then I turned it in. After lunch we played this game called Angoria. Its super addicting and I enjoyed playing it. After about an hour of playing that we had a lecture on performance by Ben. The lecture was interesting but just a tad long. This week is going to be filled with new information and I have to prep myself for what's to come. Hopefully I can understand and retain the information that's presented to me. Pretty good day at devcodecamp.
