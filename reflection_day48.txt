Today at devcodecamp, we spent the day working on SQL zoo. I must say that mid way through the day I was losing the motivation to continue doing these tutorials. They are so tedious and I just want to pull my hair out. I'll be doing some studying tonight because we just found out today that we will be tested on this on monday. I guess thats a little motivation for me.
