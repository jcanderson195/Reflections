Today at devcodecamp, the focus was working on our custom string projects along with our sweepstakes project. I didn't get through the custom linked list class on the custom string class and honestly I don't know if will get finished with it. I still have to do the sweepstakes project and the calculator project. On top of those assignments that are due monday morning, we also have an exam on everything we've learned this week in lecture. I feel overwhelmed and am lacking the time to efectively get these assignments done. That does'nt include the amount of time it will take to solve any roadblocks that I may come across while coding out the sweepstakes project and the calculator assignment. I also don't understand the concepts we covered in lecture so trying to find time to study along with doing projects is going to destroy me this weekend because I have to work.
