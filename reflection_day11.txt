Today at DevCodeCamp, we had our practice exam. The exam lasted all day and could have had anything we covered so far in Java. I was nervous for the exam because it will really show how much I know about Java. I felt ok going into the exam after studying from the weekend and this morning. The nerves really started getting to me once the test was handed out. It consisted of three questions. The first question I understood the concept but I wasn't sure how to execute the code the way my instructors wanted. I know that for a fact. I answered it to the best of my ability and moved on to question two. Question two was probably where I got the most points from the test in my opinion. I knew exactly what to do and I think I did really well on the question. The third question was similar to the first in the thought that I wasn't sure how to execute the code like my instructors wanted me to. I once again answered the question to the best of my ability. I finished around two o'clock. After that, I went over things in my previous projects to refresh my self on what I may have missed on the test. Overall, an ok day at DevCodeCamp.
