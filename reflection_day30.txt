Today at DevCodeCamp, we continued to focus on our netflix catalog project. I'm still struggling to wrap my head around the concepts for this project. I feel like I'm not making any progress toward a finish product and its really frustrating me. When an instructor would help me, it would clearify something in the code momentarily but shortly after, I confuse myself again and I'm back at square one. The weekend is moving closer and closer and I still don't have any substantial progress. And I know that I won't have much time to work on it due to the fact that I have to work this weekend. I'll just have to make time to make some sort of progress.
