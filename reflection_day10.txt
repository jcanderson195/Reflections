Today at devCodeCamp, our focus was working on our Nim game and the happy numbers assignment. I have the bulk of the Nim game finished. I just have to complete the hot seat version of the two player mode. I think that part will be easy because I have the two player classic version done, I just have to take that code, put it in the two player hot seat function and make it so that player 1 can always win. I say it will be easy but it can easily take me all day like the two player classic mode did. The only reason it took me so long was because I wanted to figure it out for my own without any help from the instructors. I literally worked through every possible solution I could think of to keep track of how many counters were left after each player pulled their pieces. I ended up figuring it out and then I had figure out how to make sure one player wins the game. I ended up figuring that out and now I'm on to completing the assignment. Over the weekend, I plan to study hard for the practice exam. I need to do good, even if its a practice exam. A lot depends on how I do.
