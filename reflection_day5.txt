Today at DevCodeCamp, we started learning about methods, functions, constructors, and classses. In the initial lecture these terms and concepts made sense to me. But when it came to actually implementing them in my story, I struggled hard. I couldn't grasp the concepts. I tried to do the tutorial on codecademy but that didn't help either. I completed that tutorial but it still wasn't clicking. It wasn't until I watched some youtube tutorials that it started to click. I then was able to implent these concepts into my story. Another thing we did today was view some of the students from another class's capstone projects. This was very interesting because we got to see a glimpse of some of the coding languages we'll be learning in practice and how they can create amazing projects. This was also a relief for me because it reassured me that it is possible to make it through the program despite the amount of rigor and hard work you have to put in to it. I'm proud to be a part of this program and I'm still looking ofrward to learning new things in coding.
