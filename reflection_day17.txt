Today at devCodeCamp, we had a similar day like yesterday. We did some more problem solving problems where Andrew did the problems first and then we did them after. Today was harder than yesterday. The problems were a lot more difficult and I ended the day not finishing them. I'll have to go home and work on them. Hopefully I can successfully get them done.
