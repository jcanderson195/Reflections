Today was a little better than yesterday. I'm getting used to the way class is set up when it comes to lab and lectures. Today in the first lecture, we went over networking and different aspects like http, https, telnet, etc. We also went over the uses for a firewall and how its useful for setting protocols on what comes in and goes out information wise from your computer. In the second lecture, we had our run through of HTML and CSS. We also covered responsive design and how it relates to how the information on a webpage is displayed on different window sizes. I'm relatively familiar with HTML and CSS from college while the responsive design was new to me. Overall, another successful day at DevCodeCamp.
