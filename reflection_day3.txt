Another day at DevCodeCamp. Today we went over different types of networks like Tier 1,2,and 3. Also at the beginning of the day, we continued working on our web pages by incorporating tables into them. I'm already familiar with tables and how to use them so this task was relatively easy for me. The second lecture we went over was how google is our friend. We discussed different ways to search for information using google such as site:(.com) and google advanced search. After we completed that our task was to find the information necessary to have a 64 all AI game in Civ 5. This was a lot harder than it sounds because the answer wasn't right in our faces when we initially searched for it. We really had to dig for it. I struggled with this because I thought I found the answer but I felt that it wasn't as descriptive as I thought it should be so I continued to search for the answer. I ended up finding the answer. Our next task was host our site on a localhost on our computer. I was not able to successfully do this because I believe my computer is missing information to complete this task. After lunch we had a review for the exam we were about to take. The exam itself wasn't that hard. I thought it was cover everything we've discussed in the past couple days extensively so I was definitely scared because of that. I missed a few answers but overall, I feel I did pretty good on this exam. Overall, another successful day at DevCodeCamp.
