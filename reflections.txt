Today was a brand new start for me. Starting my training to become a junior software engineer. I'm not going to lie and say that today was easy because it wasn't. Like they advertised, its a lot of new information coming your way fast. I'm still confident in my abilities but I'm starting to feel the burn already on day 1. The main thing, I know I have to practice is Gitbash and the concepts along with that. I'm going to go home and work on that on codeacademy to better famaliarize myself with it. We covered binary code and how to convert it to decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and time. That wasn't too hard though it took a little more time than I thought.The day didn't seem long because we were always busy and it felt good to see time going by so fast. Overall, I think today went pretty well.
