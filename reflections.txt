Today was a brand new start for me. Starting my training to become a junior software engineer. I'm not going to lie and say that today was easy because it wasn't. Like they advertised, its a lot of new information coming your way fast. I'm still confident in my abilities but I'm starting to feel the burn already on day 1. The main thing, I know I have to practice is Gitbash and the concepts along with that. I'm going to go home and work on that on codeacademy to better famaliarize myself with it. I know I got this. Everyone's rooting for me and I don't want to let them down. Justin you got this! Keep your head up. The storm is coming but it'll pass and when it does, good things will come your way!
