Today at DevCodeCamp wasn't a very one for me. After our scrum, we were given a challenge to convert decimal numbers to Roman numerals and back. I for the life of me could not get any part of this to work for me. This truly frustrates me because I feel that sometimes simple tasks in Java are what I'm struggling in. Its not that I'm struggling in the syntax of Java; its that I'm struggling to understand the approach I should take to coding the assignments. There are some guys in the class that clearly know what they are doing and when they are given an assignment, they know exactly how to go about coding the assignment. That's what I struggled with on this last practice exam. On questions 1 and 3, I understood the concepts of what they were asking me to do but I struggle knowing exactly how to approach the problem and initially get it going. I figure its something that I will learn overtime with a lot more practice both inside the class room and outside at home but for right now its really starting to become a recurring issue in my studies and its starting to reflect on the amount of work I'm able to get done. I feel that if this sort of thing and or feeling happens again, I will sit down one on one with one of the instructors and discuss my issue. Once again, its not so much that I'm not understanding the concepts we are covering. Its more on along the lines of, I struggle to really get an assignment going because I don't know what my approach should be to get started. Today was frustrating and now that we are starting C#, I really need to get a handle on my issue because if not, I know without a shadow of doubt that it will affect me negatively in the coming weeks and my work will show for it.
