Today at devCodeCamp, we finished our Dice game. We implemented the challenge of adding a betting system into the game and it worked out pretty well. After we turned in our projects, we went into the lecture room and watched Adam recreate his own version of the game we just spent two days creating. It was interesting to see Adam's thought process in making his game and he sometimes took some of our feedback into account when creating his game. After that, we got our new assignments of creating the game of Nim and creating happy numbers. I looked at the game of Nim from the video our instructors posted in slack and it didn't seem that difficult. It wasn't until I actually tried working it out in eclipse that it was a harder than I thought. I'll be working on this assignment for a while.
