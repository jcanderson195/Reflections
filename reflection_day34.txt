Today at DevCodeCamp, I successfully completed the dealership mini project with little to no issues. Honestly this is the best I've felt leaving the day during this program. I was confident in my abilities and I got my assignment done. Tomorrow I hope the same work flow comes smoothly as well. Great day at devcodecamp.
