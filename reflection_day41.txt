Today at DevCodeCamp, we had our exam on in the morning. We also turned in our 3 projects from last week. I honestly didn't do nearly as well as I wanted to on the projects. I spent too much time working on the ICustomString project during the week and then on the weekend tried to cram out both the calculator (which isn't anything special) and the sweepstakes project which I stayed up until 4 am on Sunday working on it because I had to work during the bulk of the day on saturday and sunday. I need to manage my time better so that I don't have to do that ever again. Also today we got approved for our new project. Overall, a very tiring day at DevCodeCamp.
