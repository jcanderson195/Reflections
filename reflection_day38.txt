Today at devcodecamp, we got a new project today. It looks a little difficult but according to our instructors its one of the quintessential projects in this program and that what we learn from it will be great when it comes to getting a job in software development in the future. I'll probably be spending sometime tonight to work on it. Hopefully I can make some progress in it so that I can really get on a roll tomorrow during class. We also had another 2 and half hour lecture after lunch on design patterns. The lecture was once again very informative. After the lecture, Ben gave us another smaller assignment on top of what we are doing. The work is really starting to pile up. Hopefully I can keep up and keep sane with all this new information. Today was an ok day at devcodecamp.
