Today at DevCodeCamp, we focused on working on Netflix catalog seeing as it was our last day to work on it. Today honestly was the lowest my confidence has been since I bombed the practice exam back when we were studying Java. The thing frustrates me is that my confidence was extremely high after doing great on my lemonade stand project and it was high working on my animal shelter project. But once I started on the netflix catalog project, over the course of three days working on it, my confidence plumented tremendously. It plumented because I couldn't get anything to work. I understood what the result would be of completing certain requirements but I couldn't get the right code to get fit those requirements. Once again, I would ask an instructor of help and their help with relieve me very briefly because shortly after I would be toiling in my frustration again. Tonight is going to be a long night because I have to have something prepared to turn in tomorrow.
