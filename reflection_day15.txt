Today at DevCodeCamp, our focus for the day was working on our Robot project in C#. I'm feeling pretty good about my project. The concepts of C# are starting to really click and I'm starting to really get a hold on my robot project. We sat down one on one with mike and we went over our banker assignment. He said I did well on the assignment and its clear that I'm making progress. He then had a do a quick coding challenege to see our thought process when starting an assignment. Once again he said I did very well and that I'm really getting a firm handle on the concepts of C#. When it comes to the robot project, I'm currently working on my repair fleet class and once I finish that then I will figuring out how to implement my repair fleet and my recharge fleet into my project. I plan to finish the project this week end and do some more online studying to further my learning experience. Overall, a good day at DevCodeCamp and 3 weeks completed!
