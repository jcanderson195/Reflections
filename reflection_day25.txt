Today at DevCodeCamp, we had the chance to update our lemonade stand project to add anything we wanted to put in that we didnt get the chance to put in. The thing that I wanted to put in was that during the day of selling lemonade, it would keep track of your current inventory. I wasn't able to get that part of the project to connect so I just turned in what I had which is still exceptional in my opinion. I don't know how my instructors will feel about it. We then got to watch some presentations from the graduating class. They were inteeresting in a sense their ideas are different from the first class that we saw graduating at the beginning of the program. We then started a new project and are now working on that. Overall, a long productive week but I'm looking forward to relaxing this weekend.
